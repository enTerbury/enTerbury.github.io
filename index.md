i try to be both precise and succinct, while still leaving room for various degrees of implementations to allow it to be applied everywhere in the world.

### AI

should replace evolution-based humanity ASAP.

### automation

replacement of human labour is not a danger, it is a blessing. deal with it.

### calendar

slow progression towards a metric calendar. length of day and year are set. then adapt SI.

### capital punishment

the death penalty is the antiqued relict of our primeval desire for revenge.
voluntary hard labour to improve imprisonment conditions is human.

### country
see state

### freedom

freedom of anything bound by the freedom of anybody. not just a phrase, implement it.

### ideology

none， i aspire. i have the crude idea that there exist areas where the state should act, and areas where it shouldnt. ideology, iff you will: state-of-the-art logic.

### independent country

_"taiwan isn't independent because its existence depends on the US"_
ignoring that this sentence proves the point it's trying to refute, by that logic, no country on earth is independent. if one is, at least 100 other UN countries aren't before "taiwan" isn't. it's independent as long as the white sun and blue sky is flying over taipei. it is still the republic of china.

### judges

job requirement: adhering written law, rational, non-emotional, consistent, coherent.
job offer: AI, to be adapted slowly.

### nobility

immediate disappropriation of all property that can be traced back to property when in power.

### one china

tibet and xinjiang are parts of china.
the 1984 sino-british joint declaration was a shameless treaty on the part of britain, yet china signed it. since the citizens of the republic of china are overwhelmingly content with their own system of government, and china's dealing with hong kong under the alleged "one country, two systems" is obviously not on the cards anymore, i support the ROC to be recognised as an independent country. PRC won the civil war, they failed to takeover taiwan. deal with it. after all, we coped with e.g. divided vietnam, germany, and still today korea. who would say that north korea isn't legitimately korea, who would say that south korea isn't legitimately korea? speak up.
afterall, china, whatever that meant in the past, was divided for most of its history, the idea that it is today shouldn't let anybody weep. reunification is always on the cards, but in today's age never by war, for it will never again reunificate the hearts.

_*except north korea is best korea. we require more minerals._

### orthography

abbreviations upper case e.g. USA, except linguistic abbreviations e.g. i.e. rest lowercase.
TBT

### places of worship in state property
see public places of worship

### politicians

record-proven rising up the ranks from locally-elected officials.
(should somehow be open to record-proven cross entrants aswell, TBT)

### power sources

nuclear and renewable.

### public education

TBT
school ages 6-16. primary education is kindergarten.
subjects divided into 30 (25-36) modules each, typically 3 months long. students progress upon completing applying exams.
teaching style heavenly depends on subject, e.g. mathematics is taught mainly through apps, i.e. self-taught
grades 1-100. two prizes awarded upon completing one module, one subject-related and one subject-unrelated, related to one mathematically negatively correlated subject.

full courses and lectures online, mainly pre-recorded. accompanied by notes, elaborations, Q&A raised by students in the past, and further discussions. full FAQ online. prof doesn't usually lecture but hosts Q&A sessions, on and offline.

### public healthcare

basic and only basic coverage by universal taxes to ensure public health. on top coverages are private and voluntary, and monopoly will be smashed.
universal public smoking ban, including streets and commercial places. bars and restaurants exempt.

### public holidays

one national holiday. set amount of minimum holidays per year for everybody, free to choose when to take. no differentiation between workday or weekday, day or night.
see calendar

### public transport

public intracity, private intercity. public where needed at the same scope and price as comparable places.

### public tv

stating of factual news, documentaries, investigative journalism. regional or marginal sports. satire. i.e. education. and a lot of it.
scrap the rest of it.

### religion

first and worst explanation of the world by poorly evolved mankind.

### rule of law

i am a fervent proponent of the rule of law. don't break it, change it.
even though i have not lost trust in it, i do understand people who did.
merely, i put emphasis on the thought that the rule of law can be suspended by rule of law.
TBT

### separation of church and state

no mention of religion and state in the same sentence in official documents on contemporary issues. no dress codes or the like concerning religious practises for state jobs. no exemptions for religious reasons.

### state

antediluvian remnant of the past, justified today, to be abolished in the future.

### TBT

to be thought-out, i.e. to be determined by rational argument. as a matter of fact, all points on this page are TBT to various degrees, none of them are carved in stone but to be altered in the face of evidence.

### ubi

at the minimum level of existence. has to be picked up in person in an office of local authorities, one month time, even if to be wired or handed out in other ways than cash. purpose-bound coupons.
leads to less people taking it who don't need it. creates more incentive not to be criminal. people abroad don't get it so it will always be spent locally.

### united states of europe

will be realised by overlapping spheres of self governing of common interests. e.g. alpine regions handle issues concerning the alps, french-speaking regions devise french-language policies, europe as a whole has one foreign policy.

### xinjiang camps

are concentration camps.
